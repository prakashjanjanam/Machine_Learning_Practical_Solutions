### Linear Regression - Car Price Prediction

In this Notebook, we will solve a simple problem for demonstrating Linear Regression Machine Learning Model. 

##### Challenge Description
This is the link for the [Car Price Prediction challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction) on Kaggle that we are building a model for. In short, this is about Predicting the Key Parameters that influnece a Car Price in US market. There will be some known data provided about various models of cars, the technical and economical parameters along with their prices. The model is expected to learn from it and predict the expected price for new cars to assist the business with pricing exercise.

**Linear Regression** is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a Scalar response and one or more explainatory variables. These are also called **dependant(output)** and **independant(input)** variables. (Source - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)

The ojective of this note book is to demonstrate the following concept practically:
1. **Explorator Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Data Clean-up**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Generation**
5. **Measure Model Accuracy**

We will use **Linear Regression Model** with a Cost Function called **RMSE** (Root mean Squared Error) and **R-Squared** to fit a model that is optimal. I will also leave some pointers for other means of best fitting a Linear Regression Model.
