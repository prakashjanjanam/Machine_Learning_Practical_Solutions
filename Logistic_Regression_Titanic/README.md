# 1. Titanic ML Model for Beginner
This Kernel/Notebook is built for Beginners to understand the Basic concepts of Machine learning with a practical example.

Machine learning is exciting!! We can teach Machines to learn from available Data Patterns and then the Machine in return will Predict future outcomes with the help of a Model built. 

An ML model typically goes through these important stages:

**1. Data Gathering**  - Procuring, aggregating various soures, etc. <br>
**2. Data Analysis** - Analyzing & Visualizing Patterns & Relationships (EDA) <br>
**3. Data Cleaning, Pre-Processing** - Refine data for an acceptable format, shape<br>
**4. Feature Engineering** - Derive new Features from Existing ones if needed<br>
**5. Model Building and Training** - Build the Machine learning model with Training Data<br>
**6. Model Testing and fine tuning** - Validate the Model accuracy, Tune or Re-train<br>
**7. Model Deployment** - Deploy for real time prediction once we gain confidence<br>


We shall look at all these stages in this example. Hope you will find this useful to get started.

## Challenge Description
This is the link for the [Titanic ML](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) challenge that we are building a model for. In short, this is about learning from the Passenger list from the Titanic Disaster and see if we can build a model for predicitng the chances of survival of a person. We will have Training data (train.csv) to train the model off of.

## The Algorithm
This is a very good example of Classification type of Machine Learning, where the model, provided with a set of related inputs, predicts the outcome into one of the few classes of possibilities (Survived or Didn't in this case). We will use a well known Machine Learning algorithm called . There are sevaral other relavant models as well that can solve this problem, but out of scope for this exercise.
