### Decision Tree Classifier - Iris Species Classification

In this Notebook, we will solve a simple problem for demonstrating Decision Tree Classifier Machine Learning Model. 

##### Challenge Description
This is the link for the [Iris Flower_Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) on Wiki that we are building a model for. In short, this is about Classifying the Iris flower to one of it's 3 possible species (Setosa, Virginica, Versicolor) on the basis of Flower features like Sepal legth, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width. The model is expected to learn from the data provided and predict the right sepcies for new flower data to assist the farming with the right classification.

**Decision Trees** are non-parametric supervised machine learning models used for  for Predictive model building in Classification and Regression problems. This basically works by dividing the list of samples into smaller groups based on some favourable conditions on features that helps to accurately and efficiently classify the inputs and also to predict continuous variables.

In this exercise, we will **1. Explore** the Iris data set, **2. Visualize** the data, and **3. Build a Decision Tree** with various hyper options. We will observe how different options behave on the data set, while also measuring the **4. performance with Metrics like like Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix**. 

Hope you will find this useful. Give it a Thumbs up if you like it.
